This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.0.3.

## Getting started

To setup:
* First install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). 
* After npm is installed, use `npm install` to install the Angular CLI. 
* Then use `ng serve` to run the development server, hosted locally at `http://localhost:4200/`. Initial setup will take longer, as node will need to install all dependencies before starting.
